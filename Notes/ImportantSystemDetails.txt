1) The first user that gets created in the mongodb container has root access. This user will be used by the system administrator to handle the DB. If that is a dangerous practice it should be changed accordingly.

2) The user that is used by the backend to authenticate to the DB must be created in the DB before the backend container is created. The username/password must be given to the backend container through the mongo-secret.yaml file.

3)  The producer is not asserting a queue, which means that if a consumer hasn't already been created to assert their own queue and bind it to the exchange, then all messages sent to the exchange will be lost.
