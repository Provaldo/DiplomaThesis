1) In order to install kubernetes I had to install Docker from the following url:
https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/docker/

2) The previous led me to:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
I followed the steps described and then went on to 3:

3) https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/

4) I skipped this step because I'm not sure I want Docker to start on boot:
	Configure Docker to start on boot

	Most current Linux distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu 16.04 and higher) use systemd to manage which services start when 		the system boots. Ubuntu 14.10 and below use upstart.
	systemd

	$ sudo systemctl enable docker

	To disable this behavior, use disable instead.

	$ sudo systemctl disable docker

5) Also skipped the next step because I don't know shit about security:
	Configure where the Docker daemon listens for connections

	By default, the Docker daemon listens for connections on a UNIX socket to accept requests from local clients. It is possible to 		allow Docker to accept requests from remote hosts by configuring it to listen on an IP address and port as well as the UNIX socket. For more detailed information on this configuration option take a look at “Bind Docker to another host/port or a unix socket” 		section of the Docker CLI Reference article.

	Secure your connection:
	Before configuring Docker to accept connections from remote hosts it is critically important that you understand the security 		implications of opening docker to the network. If steps are not taken to secure the connection, it is possible for remote non-root 	users to gain root access on the host. For more information on how to use TLS certificates to secure this connection, check this 		article on how to protect the Docker daemon socket.

7) to test whether docker was installed correctly. prints the message underneath the command:

I made it so it doesn't need sudo so this isn't needed -> ($ sudo docker run hello-world)
$ docker run hello-world

(Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
